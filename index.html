            <p>Tips, facts, experiences, what we did right, what we did wrong and Open Hatch’s Open Source comes to Campus event.</p>
<h1 id="Before_we_head_off,_a_short_history-">Before we head off, a short history.</h1><p>I have been a student at City College of San Francisco since Fall 2012. In the Fall 2014 and Spring 2015 semester, I had the good fortune to work with Katherine and the Coders Club to put on Open Hatch’s ‘<a href="http://campus.openhatch.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Open Source comes to Campus</a>‘ event. A day long workshop, OSCTC is a place for fledgling or expert programmers and non-technical but interested individuals to learn the fundamentals of open source technology and beliefs via a curriculumn developed by Open Hatch and taught by local open source hackers. This was the Coders Club’s fourth time hosting this workshop.</p>
<p>Being provided the opportunity to host Open Hatch’s Open Source Comes to Campus event at City College has had to be one of the most rewarding experiences I have had in the last few years. I experienced personal growth as I fulfilled roles as a student leader, an event organizer, financial planner and even an impromptu mentor. I have seen first hand the enjoyment fellow students had as they learned new skills and made friends with local Bay Area hackers and peers. Perhaps the most fulfulling part of this awesome experience has been the feeling that I was a part of something greater than myself. Open Hatch and City College have provided me the resources to generate interest in and provide beginners knowledge of the open source way of thinking and doing, which is something I am growing to value deeply. </p>
<p><a href="https://events.openhatch.org/events/4" target="_blank" rel="external">This is a link</a> to our most recent semesters BridgeTroll event page. It details our curriculum, number of attendee’s, number of mentors, etc. I will be using these specifics as the basis for most of my understandings of how the event went. <strong>Though, it would be nice to be able to share certain anonymized data (gender ratio, how many students were “advanced”, etc.) in a visually pleasing way.</strong></p>
<h1 id="Thanks">Thanks</h1><p>I want to thank Katherine Moloney for finding, bringing and ensuring success for Open Hatch’s program at City College. Without her kindness, sharp wit and experience, none of this would have ever been possible.</p>
<p>Without Asheesh Laroia’s  guidance and ability to lead the entire show to effortlessly well, this whole thing would have not been quite to excellent. Without Shauna Gordon-McKeon, we would not have had the tools or encouragement (or OpenHatch itself…) that are so desperately needed to pull something like this off.<br><br></p>
<h1 id="Pre-event">Pre-event</h1><h2 id="Know_your_school-">Know your school.</h2><p>I have found City College to be ripe with opportunities for the motivated student organizer. City College is <a href="http://collegestats.org/colleges/california/largest/" target="_blank" rel="external">one of the largest community colleges in California</a> and <a href="http://www.cpec.ca.gov/StudentData/StudentSnapshot.ASP?DataReport=CCCEth" target="_blank" rel="external">has quite a diverse student body population</a>, practically ensuring that there is atleast a few people in the college who share your interests and might be willing to help you or your group. The administrators have some basic resources like rooms with projectors, white boards, tables and chairs. <strong>Faculty support was crucial</strong>, and fortunately for us, abundant as some faculty going as far as to print our flyers and put them around their office or offering extra credit in their classes to come to our event. Most students, in an unofficial quick poll at the front door of the event, said they found out about the event from an in class announcement from their teacher.</p>
<h2 id="Know_your_student_body-">Know your student body.</h2><p>The students that show up to extra-curricular events are among some of the most interesting, energetic and dedicated people I have seen at City College. At the end of the big day, one mentor was very impressed with the amount of energy their students put into overcoming challenges that come with learning anything new. “They want to be there,”” the mentor exclaimed, “and its very different from your typical college classroom where half the class is asleep!” <strong>This positive vibe among the attendee’s should be encouraged.</strong> Consider how you can help shape the atmosphere in the room to match the students excitement (see <a href="#thebeginning">The beginning of the day section</a> below).</p>
<h2 id="Know_yourself-">Know yourself.</h2><p>I could not possibly imagine spending as much time as I did on organizing an event that was nothing more than a mark on someone else’s check list. I wanted to materialize a thing that represented values that I would like to see more of in the world. </p>
<p>For me, I knew I had an interest in the ideals of open source software. Not that I have always had some fervent love for open source software. I had only an inkling of what open source software was about, though I definitely had interest in developing my interest further. I think that was an excellent indicator for me to know I had found the right event to put my time into: an unexplored interest that I was eager to learn more about.</p>
<h2 id="The_cost">The cost</h2><p>We raised $1150.00 for this event. We spent $976.23. We provided lunch and breakfast for our ~70 attendees and ~8 mentors as well as paying Open Hatch a $500.00 honorarium for their amazing work. Lunch cost us $400.00 flat and covered the wide range of dietary restrictions.</p>
<h2 id="The_sources">The sources</h2><p>Firstly, ‘Software engineering’ is really big in the Bay Area right now. Secondly, I was lucky enough to work with Katherine who had already figured out the details of securing a large portion of the money from <a href="http://workforcedevelopmentsf.org/trainingprograms/images/stories/TrainingPrograms/TechSF/3.8.12_TechSF_Initiative.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external">TechSF</a>, a San Francisco initiative to pay for high tech job skills training. <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank" rel="external">Mozilla</a>, the makers of FireFox, was able to sponsor our event as well as provide valuable in person mentors (time is money, as they say). Finally, we were able to petition our school government for a large portion of money. </p>
<p>Regrettably, I found the school to have the most obstacles in the way of raising money as we had to constantly navigate needlessly restrictive rules, outdated rules that barred us from spending over $300 on lunch (read: less than $4.00 a person for an event this size), and an ever shifting policy that defies our collective attempt at streamlining this painful process.</p>
<p>In general, we found success by petitioning our local government, local business that would have an interest in our event, and our school government. For each group, we explained our goals with the event, gave links for them to find out more via Open Hatch’s website, and prepared an orderly display of our expenses so the group could see specifically where their money would be going. <strong>Making contact and building a relationship with someone in these people’s offices has enabled us to continue to reliable receive money over the years.</strong></p>
<p>We have never tried fund raising via bake sales or other ‘events.’ I am not sure whether a fund raising event would actually bring in a significant amount of cash, but it would act as form of advertising for your event. I feel that having physical markers around the school (flyers, events, etc) serves to solidify the event as ‘real’ in students minds, as well as simply reaching a wider audience. <strong>If I were to put this event on again, I would seriously consider some type of fund raising event to just to advertise.</strong></p>
<h2 id="Finding_students">Finding students</h2><p>We have been able to gather ~70 students almost every semester by </p>
<ol>
<li>sending emails to faculty asking them to make in class announcements,</li>
<li>flyers, and</li>
<li>scheduling before midterms.<br>Open Hatch has excellent resources for both <a href="https://openhatch.org/wiki/Email_templates#Publicity_Emails" target="_blank" rel="external">pre-written emails</a> and <a href="https://github.com/openhatch/open-source-comes-to-campus/tree/master/publicity/flyers/publicity_flyer_templates" target="_blank" rel="external">flyers</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>We are looking into how to increase student turn out. </p>
<p>One issue is that we have very little data on the students that attend. When I was helping Katherine put on the first iteration of the event, we were able to have people sign up through our own website, as opposed to BridgeTroll, and have people sign up through a custom Google Forms survey. We were able to ask questions like “How did you discover the event” that helped us as organizers know the limit of our success. Another type of question, like “What part of the workshop are you most excited about,” was useful to see what types of things students think they are most interested in. This was nice to know so we could potentially emphasize this aspect of the event next time, or flesh it out/take more time with it. <strong>It would be very nice to at least be able to add optional questions for students to answer to the BridgeTroll student and mentor sign up forms (see: <a href="https://github.com/shaunagm/bridge_troll/issues/16" target="_blank" rel="external">this issue on the GitHub repo.</a></strong></p>
<p>I can’t help but imagine increasing our physical presence at the school in the weeks leading up to the event not increasing student turnout. What would be truly awesome is some kind of ‘Open Source Hack Day’ or an open source speaker to come to the college. <strong>It would be an excellent idea for someone to create a GitHub repo of fun and simple pre-event events that organizers could hold as a way of promoting the Open Hatch event.</strong></p>
<h2 id="Finding_mentors">Finding mentors</h2><p>I have to admit that we have a lot of help here in San Francisco. Not only is there a lot of hype around technology in general in San Francisco, <a href="https://openhatch.org/people/paulproteus/" target="_blank" rel="external">Asheesh</a>, a huge contributor to Open Hatch, is currently living in the Bay Area. Through Asheesh’s connections and being in the city, we have a huge potential for mentors. Asheesh is also an excellent lead mentor and makes sure the whole show runs excellently.</p>
<h2 id="What’s_in_it_for_the_mentors">What’s in it for the mentors</h2><p>Among the things we usually explain to new mentors is what the benefits for them are. We usually mention that they can spread the word about their project and find potential contributors among the attending students. We are finding that the latter is usually not the case. Perhaps its just that City College is a junior college, which means that the typical-ish student at City College is there between 2-3 years and has not taken any upper division courses. At the typical level I am seeing students at, they are not ready to contribute to an open source project.</p>
<p>What I mean to say is that what’s in it for a mentor, currently, is providing the possibility for sparking an interest in a fledgling developer. Mentors come away from Open Source comes to Campus excited by how stoked the students were to be there and laughing and learning. Watching a newbie have the light go on in their head, or making a friend while trying to fix a bug, really is a special reward for only an 8 hour event.</p>
<h2 id="Helping_mentors_prepare">Helping mentors prepare</h2><p>OpenHatch is attempting to curate open source projects that are prepared to introduce newbies. There efforts are <a href="https://openhatch.org/wiki/OpenHatch_affiliated_projects" target="_blank" rel="external">currently in the works</a>, with a few “recommended” projects that are particularly welcoming to a newbie. If a mentor has no project to on board students to, they may find interest in helping students contribute to the projects on this list. Wikipedia is also really easy to begin contributing to and non-technical, making it easy for mentors and students alike to dive right in.</p>
<p>However, mentors who already have some on boarding process setup for beginner contributors tend to find that no contributions are made at the end of the day. This is to be expected when most of the students are near total beginners. <strong>The real goal for a mentor interested in on-boarding students onto their project is to get students to stay interested in their project even after the event as ended</strong>. Reassuring students that the mentor is there to find them a part of the project that is interesting to the student, swapping emails and building excitement for why the project is so cool is an excellent way to retain potential contributors, and hopefully have them become self-sustaining members of the open source community.<br><br></p>
<h1 id="The_Big_Day:_Thoughts">The Big Day: Thoughts</h1><h2 id="Student_Experiences">Student Experiences</h2><p>I have attempted to gather some first hand accounts of students experiences. So far, I have two people who have responsed to my queries:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before open hatch I had doubts about picking CS as a major or a minor or just<br>continue learning it in general. After the event I have decided to study computer<br>science in greater depth. </p>
<p>Mentors did an amazing job. They were patient and nice and answered pretty much<br>every one of my stupid questions. It was very interesting and inspiring to listen to<br>each story. All in all, I couldn’t have spend that Saturday better. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Siuzanna Arutiunova, City College of San Francisco Student</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was talking with a mentor about my uncertainty on choosing the computer science major.<br>The mentor was kind enough to let me meet her for lunch and see what she does as a programmer!</p>
<p>Thanks OpenHatch for such an excellent opportunity! </p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>OpenHatch Attendee and City College of San Francisco student.</em></p>
<h2 id="The_beginning_of_the_day"><p id="thebeginning">The beginning of the day</p></h2><p>In the beginning of the day, students seemed a bit shy. I feel a bit responsible for that as I imagine these students walking into a large room, is full of strangers, without much guidance of exactly what is going to happen. <strong>Planning for someone to be a door greeter, projecting the schedule on the wall (which Asheesh thought of, thanks!), and maybe playing some music may help ease students into the unfamiliar space</strong>. By the end of the day, none of this was a problem as it appeared that everyone was very engaged and talkative.</p>
<p>I can’t help but mention that members of the Coders Club were so stoked on the event that we got together and made a thank you email for the mentors and Open Hatch. You can find that email as a blog post on OpenHatch’s blog, <a href="http://blog.openhatch.org/2015/thank-you-from-city-college-of-san-francisco/" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Student:Mentor_ratio">Student:Mentor ratio</h2><p>From the sidelines, it seems some students can quickly get lost if there are not enough mentors to guide everyone through the activities. With our pairing of ~8 mentors for ~70 students, it seemed we could have used maybe twice the amount of mentors we had. <strong>I think it would be beneficial to have a list of ‘expert’ students planned out in advance who could act as junior mentors to field some of the easier trouble shooting problems that innevitably arise as people begin the activities.</strong></p>
<h2 id="Favorite_sections">Favorite sections</h2><p>My informal census states that, by and large, the Career Panel (“musical chairs” version) and the GitHub Activity are the beloved darlings of the whole show. Even with the amount of mentors we had, we could have easily spent &gt;2 hours rotating mentors through all the tables and letting them talk the students about their jobs, projects, and stories of joining the open source force. The GitHub Activity seems to go over so well since students get the “this is what its really like” feeling in a controlled and mentored environment. </p>
<h2 id="Handling_“beginners”_and_“experts”_during_the_event-">Handling “beginners” and “experts” during the event.</h2><p>Even before the BridgeTroll pages this year, we tried to track students based on what boiled down to “beginner,” “intermerdiate” and “advanced.” If your going to learn from the workshops and lectures, your probably a beginner or intermediate. If your ready to contribute to an open source project, your probably advanced. The large majority of our students selected beginner or intermediate, with only 3 of our ~60 students at the last event checking advanced. </p>
<p>We have tried to provide for intermerdiate to advanced students with an extra table during the “Github Activity,” where the idea is to pair them with a mentor who can field more advanced git questions (or whatever students have questions about). This did not work out since the beginners were a majority and required all of our (admittedly short-staffed) mentors. Advanced students seemed ok with helping other students around them and enjoying the free food, but I can’t but feel I failed to deliver much value to them during the GitHub Activity. <strong>Planning alternate activities for the advanced students during the GitHub Activity would help advanced students gain as much from the activity as the beginner and intermediate students.</strong> During the lectures, career panels and contribution workshop, both beginners and experts seemed to have an excellent time, however.</p>

            <p>Wow. No way.</p>
<p>That’s the feeling I had today when the Coder’s Club officially ended. Well, I was done with it at least. Soon I will be gone, off to UC Santa Cruz to “Do the Right Thing” and get a degree. I feel pulled in two directions about leaving: its “Right” but there’s so much else that I do not want to leave behind here.</p>
<p>But enough with that, as I have a deeper hungering to share my experience of the Coder’s Club. Not the coder’s club as it was in the immediate experience, but the Coder’s Club I had envisioned. </p>
<p>I had first glimpsed the coder’s club two semesters ago as a silent observer of a talk on virtual machines. I arrived late and it was a bit of an intimidating space, as technical talks with a roomful of other silent observers often are. Despite the then coder’s club president’s best efforts to share his enthusiasm by catching me as I tried to creep out the back door, I left feeling unconnected to the club. I had never been a part of a club before so thats why I felt so awkward, I told myself. Whatever the reason was, I stayed through the activity of the day and left immediately after due to perceived awkwardness of having to <em>gulp</em> talk with people.</p>
<p>I did end up becoming friends with the president, and this lead me to stick around the next semester. This time, It was almost exclusively a group of friends that I knew from other classes and so was quite comfortable in that small circle of nerds that met every week. We mostly just sat around and talked, as friends do, and were not very welcoming to newcomers. Not that we were mean to any of those poor souls who stumbled into our classroom who maybe shyly asked “are you Coders?” or more likely just leaving the room after a few seconds of bumbling around. But we did very little to share our laughter with them. I don’t think we had any visions at this point, mostly it was just “us.”</p>
<p>If the Coder’s Club values Inclusiveness, then active vigilance is required by those who “are in.” There are 1000 reasons a student may for not showing up or returning to club meetings, so lets not be one of them. More then just not being a reason, Coders should strive to reach out and embrace those students who are interested in what we do. Katherine has mentioned having someone (in my words) “stand guard” at the door to actively introduce the new comers to the space and the people. This is merely one way that our value of Inclusiveness must radiate from our actions. Designing of the space and activities must also radiate Inclusiveness. Try getting rid of the awful practice of having chairs face the front of the room, and instead leave only enough chairs to accommodate the estimated amount of attendee’s and arrange them in a circle. For an activity, <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/ccsfcoders/think$20pair$20share/ccsfcoders/dstJgaUqAdo/jhOsrE5TGagJ" target="_blank" rel="external">consider my thoughts on the “Think, Pair, Share” activity</a> (thanks, Asheesh!). In my own experience as a first time attendee, having club activities helps familiarize newcomers to the unfamiliar faces and provides incentive for returning to the club week after week.</p>
<p>This last semester may have been the last semester, if I had not become president. The previous coder’s club president had left the coder’s club without finding time to assign anyone the task of running the club next semester. Attendance had stopped well before the end of the semester among the ~5 of us that showed up anyhow. If it was not for Katherine, the original founder who still keeps an eye on the club, reaching out on the forums, the coder’s club may have petered out.</p>
<p>Did the coders club become the Coder’s Club when I first signed the paperwork to become “President?” Did it happen in one of those countless hours planning the next days activities, or when I decided to help bring Open Hatch to CCSF? No, these are merely symptoms of a much deeper compulsion. I had a Vision. I knew what I wanted to build up in this world, and the Coder’s Club would be my tool. I found the Coder’s Club can be used for a wide variety of purposes, and each helped me bring my Vision one step closer to reality.</p>
<p>The Coder’s Club is a label. For whatever reason, when people see “Sincerely, CCSF Coders Club” at the bottom of an email, they are much more likely to respond to requests with an agreeableness not normally reserved for Random College Student. They may not see my Vision, but they see the label and have a host of assumptions about who we are as individuals and what we do. One example was our tour of Double Fine (side note: totally epic!). Double Fine was willing to help the Coders Club because they “knew” us (though, it did help I knew the Lead Programmer there from prior meet ups). Another example is how we raise $500.00 every semester we run the Open Hatch event from San Francisco city government. These groups trust us and our mission, even though they don’t know us as individuals.</p>
<p>The Coder’s Club is a part of CCSF. Space is not cheap in San Francisco, and neither are the projectors, chairs, janitorial services and utilities the school provides us. Money is available as well, despite my previous disappointment on the hurdles to receiving the money. The money is not a lot (and can’t be spent in all the ways we wish it could), but its something to get us started! Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, the school provides us a community to reach out too. Advertising is mostly reserved for those who are a part of CCSF, so we are able to advertise to a huge community of potentially like minded people. </p>
<p>These properties of the Coder’s Club are strongest when combined. For example, We have often found our most successful advertisement campaigns to be through teacher announcements. Teachers are not obligated to help the Coders Club advertise, but our label goes farther then who we are as individuals and so they help us. Recognizing these properties and their power when combined early on helped me see how I could found my Vision in this world.</p>
<p>The people behind the Coder’s Club are even more important then the properties of the Coder’s Club. I needed help to see the Vision come to reality, and so I turned towards the lady who started the club originally: Katherine.</p>
<p>Katherine is and continues to be the life force behind the Coders Club. She was an indispensable resource for planning the big events and helped kick start the club with the Peer Advising event we hold in the beginning of every semester. This is usually our big recruitment event for the semester, and we get great attendance rates thanks to in class teacher announcements.</p>
<p>But these students did not stick around much, it seemed, semester after semester. How do I infect people with my Vision? How can I get them too see what I see? I think before even these questions is to share with them my excitement. My Energy. I believed that if I infused as much Energy as possible into the Coders Club, that others could not help but be attracted to it. Keeping in line with my value of Inclusiveness, I created activities that encouraged student involvement and were accessible by anyone interested in technology: the Lightning Talk and Coding Challenges. I created an agenda to answer that ever-present question of “yea that sounds cool, but what does the Coders Club do?” I created a flyer and recruited a previous coders club member to help me post them around school.</p>
<p>And people started showing up. Then the people who showed up, came back. Soon we had regular attendee’s, and they were excited about what the club was doing. We have, I am proud to say, over 15 lightning talks with 10 of them being recorded - most of them not by me! When I told a friend about the “coding challenges” I put together, she was shocked that people actually were, in her words, “doing homework” for the club. It hardly felt like work when we all would sit around and review the ingenious solutions various coders would present, laughing as the light bulbs went on in their head and they understood what was going on beneath the surface of those white screens with black text.</p>
<p>The Vision has been the driving force behind all this work. The playing of the Coder’s Club strengths as a school club and the Energy I put in to kick-start the whole process is pointless without some, well, point. What was the point?</p>
<p>At first I almost stated the point, the Vision, was something high and mighty. I almost said I wanted to change the world and do Right in the world. But I think this is not my Vision. I think what caused my Vision was my own selfishness. I find in my life that I rarely have others who I can share my nerd-ness with in some other context besides a job. Computers have and probably always will be a place I can go to explore fantastical worlds made up of nothing less than magic that causes the ghosts inside this machine to dance and play before my mind. I wanted to find other eager explorers of this magical world, and unlock its mysteries with them. The people were not tool’s to that end, they are the end!</p>
<p>Leaving the Coder’s Club will be hard. Other clubs have other Visions, but I hope I can find the contingent that cares about my Vision the same way this Coder’s Club did!</p>

            <p>When attempting to login to my late 2011 MacBook Pro today, I found my screen acting just like the screen in this video: </p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kCLNOa1Gvs0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Jeez.</p>
<h1 id="The_problem">The problem</h1><p>I spent some time googling random words attempting to describe the issue until I came across the above video on Youtube. The solution posted in the comments did not entirely work for me; I found that my flashing screen returned upon restart.</p>
<p>My friend <a href="http://www.jimmyh.su/" target="_blank" rel="external">Jimmy Hsu</a> noticed that the solution involved<br><figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">mv /System/Library/Extensions/ATI* .</span><br><span class="line">mv /System/Library/Extensions/AMD* .</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>Which made him realize that issue was related to my graphics card. He remembered reading <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/little-utility-rescues-a-macbook-pro-with-failing-video/" target="_blank" rel="external">about</a> <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2014/10/28/macbook-pro-2011-graphics-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="external">issues</a> <a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/08/12/apple-ignores-calls-to-fix-2011-macbook-pro-failures-as-problem-grows" target="_blank" rel="external">with</a> MacBook Pro’s from 2011, and a short trip to google <a href="http://earthwithsun.com/questions/836910/disable-discrete-graphics-card-on-macbook-pro-early-2011" target="_blank" rel="external">landed me at this website</a> which contained a very detailed solution.</p>
<p>In short, the hardware in late MacBook Pro 2011’s is faulty.</p>
<h1 id="The_solution">The solution</h1><p>Apple has finally acknowledged the defect and are currently offering extended warranties and an entire repair program, <a href="http://www.macworld.co.uk/news/mac/widespread-2011-macbook-pro-failures-petition-lawsuit-repair-programme-3497935/" target="_blank" rel="external">according to Macworld.co.uk</a>.</p>
<p>If one is looking for a short term solution to back up ones files (like I was), there is a solution that worked for me. My understanding is that this solution disables one’s graphics card drivers, which gets rid of the crazy flashing login screen. Then, one uses ‘switchGPU’, a program which is a wrapper for gfxCardStatus. switchGPU will enable integrated graphics when you login.</p>
<h2 id="Short_term_solution">Short term solution</h2><ol>
<li>Boot into Single User Mode (cmd+S while booting)</li>
<li>Issue the commands (NOTE: some commands will take a short while to complete. Be patient)<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">fsck -fy</span><br><span class="line">mount -uw /</span><br><span class="line">mkdir /Disabled_System_Library_Extensions</span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">cd</span> /Disabled_System_Library_Extensions</span><br><span class="line">mv /System/Library/Extensions/ATI* .</span><br><span class="line">mv /System/Library/Extensions/AMD* .</span><br><span class="line">touch /System/Library/Extensions</span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">exit</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
</li>
</ol>
<p>One has now disabled their graphics card drivers.</p>
<ol>
<li>Login to your account. Dont be suprised at how slow and ‘laggy’ your display is, we are about to fix that.</li>
<li>Install <a href="https://github.com/joachimroeleveld/switchGPU/" target="_blank" rel="external">switchGPU</a> by following the instructions in the README.md</li>
<li>Set your account to auto-login</li>
<li>Make sure ‘Automatic Graphics Switching’ setting is checked under the ‘Energy Saver’ section in System Preferences.</li>
</ol>
<p>You should be able to use your system and backup your files!</p>
<h2 id="The_drawbacks">The drawbacks</h2><p>This solution is SHORT TERM. GET YOUR MACBOOK FIXED! The underlying issue is faulty hardware, and if you don’t get that fixed then your computer will experience complete failure at some point.</p>
<p>This solution requires auto-login, which has obvious security issues.</p>
<p>Taken from the answer on Earthwithsun.com:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The problem with this method is that the OS will switch to<br>discrete graphics whenever you run some app that uses graphics<br>acceleration. So this is not a permanent solution.</p>
