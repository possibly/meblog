          <p>I have been a student at City College of San Francisco since Fall 2012. In the Fall 2014 and Spring 2015 semester, I had the good fortune to work with Katherine and the Coders Club to put on Open Hatch’s ‘<a href="http://campus.openhatch.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Open Source comes to Campus</a>‘ event. A day long workshop, OSCTC is a place for fledgling or expert programmers and non-technical but interested individuals to learn the fundamentals of open source technology and beliefs via a curriculumn developed by Open Hatch and taught by local open source hackers. This was the Coders Club’s fourth time hosting this workshop.</p>
<p>Being provided the opportunity to host Open Hatch’s Open Source Comes to Campus event at City College has had to be one of the most rewarding experiences I have had in the last few years. I experienced personal growth as I fulfilled roles as a student leader, an event organizer, financial planner and even an impromptu mentor. I have seen first hand the enjoyment fellow students had as they learned new skills and made friends with local Bay Area hackers and peers. Perhaps the most fulfulling part of this awesome experience has been the feeling that I was a part of something greater than myself. Open Hatch and City College have provided me the resources to generate interest in and provide beginners knowledge of the open source way of thinking and doing, which is something I am growing to value deeply. </p>
<p>I want to thank Katherine Maloney for finding, bringing and ensuring success for Open Hatch’s program at City College. Without her kindness, sharp wit and experience, none of this would have ever been possible.</p>
<p>There are a number of aspects I want to discsuss about my experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>My experience, pre-event<ul>
<li>Finding the right event. (include section on skill level being a part of this type of event)</li>
<li>Fundraising.</li>
<li>Spreading the word. (finding mentors)</li>

<h1 id="Before_we_head_off-">Before we head off.</h1><p><a href="https://events.openhatch.org/events/4" target="_blank" rel="external">This is a link</a> to our most recent semesters BridgeTroll event page. It details our curriculum, number of attendee’s, number of mentors, etc. I will be using these specifics as the basis for most of my understandings of how the event went.</p>
<p>After writing most of this, I realized I did not really grasp the essence of what a day of Open Source Comes to Campus is really like. This is mainly my experience as an event organizer for future event organizers. For a better and more fundamental understanding of what these events are like (pro tip: amazing), check out <a href="http://campus.openhatch.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Open Hatch’s web page</a>.</p>
<h1 id="My_experience,_pre-event">My experience, pre-event</h1><p>I have found City College to be ripe with opportunities for the motivated student organizer. City College is <a href="http://collegestats.org/colleges/california/largest/" target="_blank" rel="external">one of the largest community colleges in California</a> and <a href="http://www.cpec.ca.gov/StudentData/StudentSnapshot.ASP?DataReport=CCCEth" target="_blank" rel="external">has quite a diverse student body population</a>, practically ensuring that there is atleast a few people in the college who share your interests and might be willing to help you or your group. The administrators have some basic resources like rooms with projectors, white boards, tables and chairs. Faculty has been extremely supportive of our clubs efforts with some going as far as to print our flyers and put them around their office or offering extra credit in their classes to come to our event.</p>
<p>The students that show up to extra-curricular events are among some of the most interesting, energetic and dedicated people I have seen at City College. At the end of the big day, one mentor was very impressed with the amount of energy their students put into overcoming challenges that come with learning anything new. ‘They want to be there,’ the mentor claimed, ‘and its very different from your typical college classroom where half the class is asleep.’ Additionally, I believe these students have set aside their time because they had an interest in what you were doing, and thus share a common connection with everyone else in the room. This connection, if encouraged, creates a pleasant buzz in the room as people go from their first ‘hello’ to making friends with peers at their table.</p>
<h2 id="Finding_the_right_event-">Finding the right event.</h2><p>I wanted to put my time into something I believed in. I could not possibly imagine spending as much time as I did on organizing an event that was nothing more than a mark on someone else’s check list. I wanted to materialize a thing that represented values that I would like to see more of in the world. </p>
<p>For me, I knew I had an interest in the ideals of open source software. Not that I have always had some fervent love for open source software. I had only an inkling of what open source software was about, though I definintly had interest in developing my interest further. I think that was an excellent indicator for me to know I had found the right event to put my time into: an unexplored interest that I was eager to learn more about.</p>
<h2 id="Fundraising">Fundraising</h2><h3 id="The_cost">The cost</h3><p>We raised $1150.00 for this event. We spent $976.23. We provided lunch and breakfast for our ~70 attendees and ~8 mentors as well as paying Open Hatch a $500.00 honorarium for their amazing work. Lunch cost us $400.00 flat and covered the wide range of dietary restrictions.</p>
<h3 id="The_sources">The sources</h3><p>Firstly, ‘Software engineering’ is really big in the Bay Area right now. Secondly, I was lucky enough to work with Katherine who had already figured out the details of securing a large portion of the money from <a href="http://workforcedevelopmentsf.org/trainingprograms/images/stories/TrainingPrograms/TechSF/3.8.12_TechSF_Initiative.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external">TechSF</a>, a San Francisco initiative to pay for high tech job skills training. <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank" rel="external">Mozilla</a>, the makers of FireFox, was able to sponsor our event as well as provide valuable in person mentors (time is money, as they say). Finally, we were able to petition our school government for a large portion of money. </p>
<p>Regrettably, I found the school to have the most obstacles in the way of raising money as we had to constantly navigate needlessly restrictive rules, outdated rules that barred us from spending over $300 on lunch (read: less than $4.00 a person for an event this size), and an ever shifting policy that defies our collective attempt at streamlining this painful process.</p>
<p>[include section on katherine getting techsf funding]</p>
<p>In general, we found success by petitioning our local government, local business that would have an interest in our event, and our school government. For each group, we explained our goals with the event, gave links for them to find out more via Open Hatch’s website, and prepared an orderly display of our expenses so the group could see specifically where their money would be going.</p>
<p>We have never tried fund raising via bake sales or other ‘events.’ I am not sure whether a fund raising event would actually bring in a significant amount of cash, but it would act as form of advertising for your event. I feel that having physical markers around the school (flyers, events, etc) serves to solidify the event as ‘real’ in students minds, as well as simply reaching a wider audience. If I were to put this event on again, I would seriously consider some type of fund raising event to advertise and potentially raise money.</p>
<h2 id="Spreading_the_word">Spreading the word</h2><h3 id="Finding_students">Finding students</h3><p>We have been able to gather ~70 students almost every semester by </p>
<ol>
<li>sending emails to faculty asking them to make in class announcements,</li>
<li>flyers, and</li>
<li>scheduling before midterms.<br>Open Hatch has excellent resources for both <a href="https://openhatch.org/wiki/Email_templates#Publicity_Emails" target="_blank" rel="external">pre-written emails</a> and <a href="https://github.com/openhatch/open-source-comes-to-campus/tree/master/publicity/flyers/publicity_flyer_templates" target="_blank" rel="external">flyers</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>We are looking into how to increase student turn out. </p>
<p>One issue is that we have very little data on the students that attend. It would be useful to know how they heard about our event and what motivated them to come. We currently bill the Open Hatch program as technical job skills training, making connections with local developers, and potential to join in on an Open Source project, so it would be nice to know which aspect students are finding themselves drawn too.</p>
<p>I can’t help but imagine increasing our physical presence at the school in the weeks leading up to the event not increasing student turnout. What would be truly awesome is some kind of ‘Open Source Hack Day’ or an open source speaker to come to the college. It would be an excellent idea for someone to create a GitHub repo of fun and simple pre-event events that organizers could hold as a way of promoting the Open Hatch event.</p>
<h3 id="Finding_mentors">Finding mentors</h3><p>I have to admit that we have a lot of help here in San Francisco. Not only is there a lot of hype around technology in general in San Francisco, <a href="https://openhatch.org/people/paulproteus/" target="_blank" rel="external">Asheesh</a>, a huge contributor to Open Hatch, is currently living in the Bay Area. Through Asheesh’s connections and being in the city, we have a huge potential for mentors. Asheesh is also an excellent lead mentor and makes sure the whole show runs excellently.</p>
<p>Among the things we usually explain to new mentors is what the benefits for them are. We usually mention that they can spread the word about their project and find potential contributors among the attending students. We are finding that the latter is usually not the case. Perhaps its just that City College is a junior college, which means that the typical-ish student at City College is there between 2-3 years and has not taken any upper divison courses. At the typical level I am seeing students at, they are not ready to contribute to an open source project.</p>
<p>What I mean to say is that what’s in it for a mentor, really, is providing the possibility for sparking an interest in a fledling developer. Mentors come away from Open Source comes to Campus excited by how stoked the students were to be there and laughing and learning. Watching a newbie have the light go on in their head, or making a friend while trying to fix a bug, really is a special reward for only an 8 hour event.</p>
<h1 id="The_Big_Day:_Thoughts">The Big Day: Thoughts</h1><h2 id="As_a_student">As a student</h2><p>I have attempted to gather some first hand accounts of students experiences. So far, I have two people who have responsed to my queries:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before open hatch I had doubts about picking CS as a major or a minor or just<br>continue learning it in general. After the event I have decided to study computer<br>science in greater depth. </p>
<p>Mentors did an amazing job. They were patient and nice and answered pretty much<br>every one of my stupid questions. It was very interesting and inspiring to listen to<br>each story. All in all, I couldn’t have spend that Saturday better. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Siuzanna Arutiunova, City College of San Francisco Student</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was talking with a mentor about my uncertainty on choosing the computer science major.<br>The mentor was kind enough to let me meet her for lunch and see what she does as a programmer!</p>
<p>Thanks OpenHatch for such an excellent opportunity! </p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>OpenHatch Attendee and City College of San Francisco student.</em></p>
<p>From the sidelines, it seems some students can quickly get lost if there are not enough mentors to guide everyone through the activities. With our pairing of ~8 mentors for ~70 students, it seemed we could have used maybe twice the amount of mentors we had. I think it would be beneficial to have a list of ‘expert’ students planned out in advance who could act as junior mentors to field some of the easier trouble shooting problems that innevitably arise as people begin the activities.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the day, students seemed a bit shy. I feel a bit responsible for that as I imagine these students walking into a large room, is full of strangers, without much guidance of exactly what is going to happen. Planning for someone to be a door greeter, projecting the schedule on the wall (which Asheesh thought of, thanks!), and maybe playing some music may help ease students into the unfamiliar space. By the end of the day, none of this was a problem as it appeared that everyone was very engaged and talkative.</p>
<p>I can’t help but mention that members of the Coders Club were so stoked on the event that we got together and made a thank you email for the mentors and Open Hatch. You can find that email as a blog post on OpenHatch’s blog, here.</p>
<p>[link to OpenHatch blog post with my mentor email!]</p>
<h2 id="As_an_organizer">As an organizer</h2><p>Running around like a chicken with your head cut-off, I remember Katherine describing how I would be during my first Open Source Comes to Campus. </p>
